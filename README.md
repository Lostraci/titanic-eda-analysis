## Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns and identify the key factors that influenced the survival rates of passengers using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques.

This analysis focuses on data cleaning, handling missing values, and visualizing correlations between variables such as **Age**, **Gender**, and **Socio-Economic Class**.

## Key Findings
Based on the analysis, the following patterns were observed:
* **Gender Priority:** Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate (~74%) compared to males (~18%), confirming the "Women and children first" protocol.
* **Socio-Economic Impact:** Passengers in **1st Class** were more likely to survive than those in 3rd Class, indicating a strong correlation between social status and survival.
* **Family Size:** Passengers traveling with small families (1-3 members) had better survival chances than those traveling alone or with large families.
* **Data Integrity:** The dataset contained significant missing values in the `Cabin` column (dropped) and `Age` column (imputed with mean).

## Technologies Used
* **Programming Language:** Python 3.13
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Aga, haklısın. O yarım kalmış haliyle GitHub'da "profesyonel" durmaz. Senin için bölümleri tam, komutları doğru ve görüntüsü şık (emojili, maddeli) bir README hazırladım.

Bunu kopyala, README.md dosyasının içindekilerin hepsini sil ve bunu yapıştır.
